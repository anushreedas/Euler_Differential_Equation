# Euler Method to solve Differential Equation

For given h(step value), tb(bound for t), A(action to perform every loop), x0(initial values of x), and F(differential function), following functions are available:
1. euler1(h,tb,x0,F)
2. euler2(h, tb, A, x0, F)
3. euler(h, tb, A, x0, F)
4. eulerCurry(h)(tb)(A)(x0)(F)
